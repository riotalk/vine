            <h3>Priscilla</h3>
            <p style="font-family:URWEgizioW01;"> Comes from a professional background in landscape design and forever holds appreciation for the earth, land, nature, and all that it provides.  From a young age, her father, Jeremiah Murphy, taught his children about fine wine from abroad: Gewurztraminer from Germany; <br>Riesling from Alsace; Chablis, Sancerre, Sauternes, and Bordeaux from their respective corners of France; perfectly aged Port from Portugal; Madera from Spain. <br> The key to the unique taste and flavor is the territory within which the grapes are grown and the varying conditions that affect the growth period. <br>  You can literally taste the characteristics of the territory.  Priscilla has carried this territory appreciation throughout her adult years as she has furthered her wine education through classes, vineyard visits, and constant tasting.  It is her mission to share this passion with others and expose people to places they may or may not go, but can experience through taste.
